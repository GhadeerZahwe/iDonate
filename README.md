> A mobile app is designed to facilitate the donation process of excess food wastes, connecting donors with delivery drivers. Complemented by a desktop admin panel, the system enhances food waste distribution, fostering a more sustainable and compassionate community.

## User Stories

### Donor:

- As a donor (individual, restaurant, or store), I want to donate excess food easily, so that I can contribute to reducing food waste in my community.
- As a donor, I want to be able to chat with an AI bot specialized in answering questions about food waste donation, so I can inquire further about donations and receive answers to my queries.
- As a donor, I want to be able to track the live location of the delivery, so that I can stay updated about whether my order is received and donation completed or not yet.

### Delivery:

- As a delivery driver, I want to be able to check the weight of the donated food using an IoT smart weight sensor, so that I can accurately verify the weight of the food waste donation before delivering it.
- As a delivery driver, I want to scan the QR code of the donor, so that the order status is updated.
- As a delivery driver, I want to be able to call the donor so that I can reach him for more details or inform him about any update.
- As a delivery driver, I want to check the weather temperature based on my current location, so that I can make informed decisions about the mode of transportation to use (e.g., motorcycle or car) for the delivery.

### Admin:

- As an admin, I want to be able to view real-time information about both users, so that I can monitor the system's performance.
- As an admin, I want to be able to approve registered delivery drivers, so that only authorized drivers can provide their services.
- As an admin, I want to be able to delete users, so that I can ensure the smooth functioning of the app's services.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - 🚨 Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
