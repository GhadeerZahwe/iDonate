<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  iDonate is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the React Native app development framework. React Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the MySQL package which allows the app to create a custom storage and save it to a local database.
